### The low level technology layer of TFGrid

**our TFGrid is unique**

- a global P2P cloud 
- our users/farmers become part of the ["be the internet" movement](strategy:tf_vision_position)

The way how to use our TFGrid is like docker on steroids, everything docker/kubernetes does we will be able to do as well.

**Exciting benefits:**

- smart_contract_for_IT capability
- integrated with a self healing unbreakable storage system: qsfs
- integrated with a planetary_network
- driven by a high level super fast/efficient development language: vlang also developed in our community and sponsored by us.
- meant to allow developers to create self healing apps

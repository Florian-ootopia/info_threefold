- we are adding many more experiences

as a protocol.me engineer we need to define/implement the protocol used by all those experiences, to allow any developer globally to expand the digital twin.

- work with Vlang, javascript, nodejs, blockchain layer
- Work in our international development team
- We are not just looking for an engineer we are looking for people who believe that the world needs a new internet and we make it happen.

### Effect of cooling (airco)

Systems need to be cooled, in the storage usecase its not really relevant because we barely use any energy per storage system and also the front ends are where the data is being produced and typically not even in a datacenter.

but even if you would like to add the effects of airco (cooling) multiply the results times 1.5 to 1.8 for a good working datacenter.

The aim of threefold is to lower the energy usage of our digital life.

We mainly do this because of the concept of digital twin and efficient storage system.

While the energy used will be lower ofcourse we still use. The energy we still use can be offset using carbon credits.

> The ThreeFold grid will be 100% carbon neutral before the end of 2021.

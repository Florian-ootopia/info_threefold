# 3Bot

3Bot is a primary use case on top of the TF Grid.

3Bot is you living digitally on the grid which gives back the ownership of your data to only you â€“ and no one else. 3Bot is a response to today's reality, your escape from the many popular centralized and often-abused applications used by a big majority of the planet. It grants you full access to a 100% neutral and decentralized digital life.

The current 3Bot is only used to be your virtual system administrator, to allow you to quickly deploy apps on top of the TFGrid.

Eventually other experience providers will provide experiences on top of the 3bot e.g. the Crystal_Twin (see alliance for conscious internet and TGP)

See how it goes with ThreeFold_Token or TFT or TFTs or TFTs. or TFTs,

### CPR

!!!include:cloud_production_rate

!!!include:cpr_reward_current

**The Farming Reward Calculation goes as follows:**

```
TFT farmed per month = CPR * CPR_REWARD
```

#### CPR Reward can change for new farmers and nodes over time.

- Current CPR price is in line with TFT base price of $0.1. If base price changes, so will the CPR price.
- The CPR reward is managed by our wisdom_council - they look at TFT price and market conditions to define the reward structure.
  - Example: it could be logical that as the grid grows the cultivation reward can go up and farming reward can go down.
  - We believe in the power of a "human blockchain" to define the right reward for new farmers.

> Note: Once you start farming, the CPR Reward will remain the same for 60 months.

#### CPR Calculation

Calculating your 3Node's CPR can be done through the [Farming Hardware Calculator](farming_hardware_calculator)

!!!include:farming_logic_disclaimer

- TFT farmed = CPR according to compute and storage capacity connected to ThreeFold and the uptime of the 3Node.
- The farmded TFTs are staked and arranged by the TF_CHAIN. 
  - For Planet-Friendly (DIY) Farmers, their TFTs will be staked until they reach 30% (\*) capacity utilization. 
  - Planet Positive Farmers can will be able to unstake their tokens when they want (starting Sept 2021).

*************************************iiiiiii



- The Farmer gets 90.2% of the farming rewards, and 9.8% of the farmed TFTs are allocated to impact projects built on the Threefold Grid. 
- The Farmer gets 10% from TF_Cultivation from capacity utilization (when users reserve capacity of 3Node).

> TFT is used to pay for support requests wihtin the Threefold Ecosystem.

To calculate the farming rewards, the following equation is used:

```
TFT farmed per month = CPR x CPR_REWARD
```

> Note: Once you start farming, the CPR Reward will remain the same for 60 months.

> Note: ThreeFold believes in the power of the 'human blockchain' to define the right rewards for new farmers. The CPR Reward can change for new farmers and nodes over time. The current CPR price is set according to current TFT price. If TFT price changes, so will the CPR price. The CPR reward is set by the wisdom_council - that oversees TFT price and market conditions to define the most fair reward structure.

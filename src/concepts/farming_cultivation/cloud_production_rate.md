# The Cloud Production Rate (CPR)

The Cloud Production Rate (CPR) indicates how ‘productive’ a computer or server hardware is. The more capacity in the form of compute and storage is added, the higher the CPR.

CPR defines the output capability just like a Solar Panel's output would be measured in kilowatt-hour (kWh).

To calculate the CPR,  a very simple and straightforward formula is used:

**CPR = 1.5 \* the amount of Compute Units (CU) of the hardware + the amount of Storage Units (SU) of the hardware**

How CU and SU are composed and calculated by [cloud units](cloud_units).

## TFGrid Farming Contribution

Note that the ThreeFold Foundation's sole purpose is to ensure the expansion of the ThreeFold_Grid and its ecosystem according to its vision and values.

To fund these activities, a part of each TFT Farming (mining) is going to the ThreeFold Foundation to finance the ThreeFold_Grid's expansion and to fund projects that are believed to bring a positive human or planet impact.

The ThreeFold Foundation uses these proceeds to

- fund operational costs for TFFoundation (promotion of grid, marketing, development, engineering)
- sponsor community projects
- doing good projects using ThreeFold Grid technology.
- optional reward staking (vesting pools)
- maybe even burning of tokens at one point of time, to lower amount of TFT in the field

The ThreeFold Wisdom_Council has to give budget approval as well approve spending to community projects and doing good projects.

See [token overview for how TFT are distributed](token_overview).

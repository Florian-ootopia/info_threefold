# ThreeFold Sales Channel

Threefold promotes 2 sales channels.

1. direct = wholesales, every person in the world can buy capacity using the ThreeFold_explorer at wholesale prices.
2. indirect = ThreeFold partners buy the wholesales capacity and are rewarded rebates by threefold to compensate for the sales effort.

## Indirect

Because of how farming is being structured (starging TFGrid 3), see [farming/minting logic](farming_logic3) there is 50-70% available of the cultivation fees to reward the sales channel. This means that the sales channel in multiple steps can be rewarded to create solutions on top of TFGrid and sell the capacity.

### Example with software vendor

A software vendor (e.g. security camera software) builds a service on top of TF_Grid and gets serious discount for using the TFGrid.

### Example with telecom company

A telco will sell the cloud capacity to its business customers, the telco gets his margin out of this cultivation fee.

### Example with system integrator.

A system integrator wants to deploy IT cloud capacity close to their customers with more security.
To reward this system integrator for the sales effort and promotion activities part of the Cultivation Fee can be used.

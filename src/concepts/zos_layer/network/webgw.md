# WebGW

![](img/webgw.png)

100% separation between
where compute workloads are
and where services are exposed.

Better Security
No IP (TCP/UDP) towards 
apps & storage = more security
= no incoming network from internet

Redundant
Each app can be exposed on multiple webgateways at once.

Support for many interfaces...

Resolves shortage of IPv4 addresses

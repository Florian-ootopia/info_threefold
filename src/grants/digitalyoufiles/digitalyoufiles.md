*The DigitalTwin Files* 

*The DigitalTwin Files* provides functionality to store (personal) files in a secure and private way. The DigitalTwin Files solution uses your personal digital twin (see Crystal Twin project) to store and retrieve files from storage capacity rented on the TF Grid. Files are stored securely in a very efficient way, using a lot less storage space to do so and also in a much more sustainable manner.

### Purpose

- neutral and allows you to own all your data
- faster
- simple and easy to use
- more cost effective
- able to work everywhere 
- equipped of advanced features like video/audio streaming
- able to seamlessly integrate with other website and documents

### Status Today

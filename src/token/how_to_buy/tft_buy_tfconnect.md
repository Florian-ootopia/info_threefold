# BUY TFT in ThreeFold Wallet

As from this release, ThreeFold Tokens can be directly bought using Bitcoin (BTC).

## Steps

### Activate your BTC wallet in the ThreeFold Connect App


This is simply done simply by clicking the `ACTIVATE` button, agree with the Terms and Conditions, and confirm the activation on the next screen.

### Deposit BTC

Once activated, your wallet address is ready to hold BTC. 
The address is the same as the one holding TFT and can be copied into memory by clicking in the upper right corner of the wallet bar in the Info Tab.

An alternative way to copy the content of the address to deposit BTC is by creating a QR code holding the address.

### Exchange BTC into TFT

Once you have BTC available in your wallet, you can use it to create a TFT buy order with it, which will be launched on the Stellar DEX.
These buy orders will be executed immediately after submission of the order, under the conditions that the price criterium is met. A trade order will lead to buying TFTs against the cheapest available price. Right now it doesn't make sense to decrease the price of the token, as this will lead to a non-fulfilled order and your wallet will 'spin' eternally.
Increasing the price can be done without risk, as the cheapest orders on the Stellar DEX are always the first ones to be used for.
So it might be very well that the price you pay for a TFT might be less than indicated.

You can find the buy option in the TFT wallet, option `BUY >`:

Confirm your buy order and then wait for execution of it in your wallet.

ThreeFold will do what it can to guarantee liquidity on the underlying exchange.

### Transfer BTC to another account

The BTC that are residing in your wallet in the ThreeFold Connect app can be transferred to any other bitcoin wallet. There is a transaction fee of 0.00000010 BTC. Next to that, there is also a withdrawal fee which is variable and that is requested from the the trustline's issuer called [Crypto Anchor](https://cryptoanchor.io/). ThreeFold transparently transmits the issuer costs related to this withdrawal, and takes no profit from it.

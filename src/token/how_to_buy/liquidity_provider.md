## How to become a Liquidity Provider in the TFT pools on PancakeSwap and earn Trading rewards.

1. You need to have a wallet configured for **Binance Smart Chain**, either via MetaMask (browser extension and mobile app) or on Trust Wallet (mobile only).
- Instructions to set up Metamask for BSC: [here](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_threefold/blob/development_token/src/token/tft_bsc_bridge/tft_bsc_metamask)
- Instructions to set up Trust Wallet for BSC: [here](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_threefold/blob/development_token/src/token/tft_bsc_bridge/tft_bsc_trustwallet)
2. You will need BNB in that wallet to cover transaction fees. Low amounts are sufficient, as the average transaction on BSC does not exceed 50ct USD.
3. Visit https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/pool
4. Click "add liquidity" 
5. Click "select currency" and paste our official contract address: **0x8f0FB159380176D324542b3a7933F0C2Fd0c2bbf** (It is very important to use this official contract address and not any other one), and then click ‘add’.
6. Choose any other currency to pair with TFT. We recommend BUSD for now, as that pool already has 360k in liquidity. Set the amount of liquidity that you want to provide for both currencies. For existing pools, the ratio between them is already fixed by the currencies and is already fixed by the market prices.
7. Click "approve" for both currencies, then confirm the wallet prompts and fees.
8. Click "supply" and confirm the wallet prompt and fee.
9. You now exchanged the selected amounts for both currencies for LPs (Liquidity Tokens) and you are providing liquidity and earning a part of the transaction fees.

# Vesting Overview

Vesting is a voluntary mechanism introduced by ThreeFold in march 2021.

It allows any ThreeFold token holder on voluntary basis to put their tokens in a vesting pool.

The tokens will gradually unlock over 48 months and there is an acceleration forseen if the price of the tokens goes up well.

> THIS IS A VOLUNTARY PROCESS. <BR>
> EACH PERSON WHO CHOSES TO VEST THEIR TOKENS KNOWS THAT THIS WILL GET THEIR TOKENS LOCKED UP.

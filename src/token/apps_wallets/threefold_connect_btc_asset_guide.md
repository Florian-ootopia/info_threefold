# What is BTC Asset on ThreeFold Connect Wallet

The ThreeFold Connect wallet allows to store both ThreeFold Tokens (TFT) as Bitcoin (BTC), as well as buy TFTs using BTC. 

__Remark__: BTC residing in your TF Connect wallet are BTC that are linked to the trustline of cryptoanchor.io.

By depositing BTC onto your ThreeFold Connect wallet, you explicitly accept any risk related to holding and transacting BTC on the Stellar network, using Cryptoanchor's trustline. Trading is at own risk.
The ThreeFold Connect app calls the Cryptoanchor API for any operation on BTC. None of the ThreeFold organisations has any commercial relationship with this company.

Withdrawing BTC from the Stellar network comes with transaction fees which are defined by Cryptoanchor. None of the ThreeFold organisations intervenes in this transaction, and ThreeFold has no liability when it comes to holding BTC on the Stellar network. 

The main purpose of offering BTC in the ThreeFold Connect wallet is to facilitate the acquiring of TFTs. The BTC wallet is not meant for long-term storage of BTC.

As a wallet holder, you are the only person that has access to the private keys allowing to generate transactions on the blockchain network. ThreeFold is unable to help you out in case you loose these private keys. 
Please don't share the app seed phrase nor the Stellar secret of your wallet with anyone. Make a secure back-up of them so that you are able to recover your wallet on another device in case your device get lost or stops functioning.

# BTC Asset on ThreeFold Connect Wallet

The ThreeFold Connect wallet allows to store both ThreeFold Tokens (TFT)), as well as buy TFTs using 'BTC Asset'. 


###  The Purpose of 'BTC Asset' on ThreeFold Connect Wallet

The purpose of activating and having BTC Asset on your ThreeFold Connect Wallet is to make it easier for you as TFT Holder to gain more TFT by depositing BTC into the wallet and trading it into TFT Asset. 

### The Technology Behing BTC-TFT Asset Trades

A crypto currency trade transaction is done by broadcasting digitally signed messages to the asset's network. Since TFT lives on Stellar Network, a TFT transaction is done by broadcasting digitally signed messages to the Stellar Network. Meanwhile, with Bitcoin, a transaction is done by broadcasting digitally signed messages to the Bitcoin Network.

Normally, a token holder would need to trade on an intermediary centralized exchange platform in order to exchange in between currencies from different networks.  But ThreeFold has made it possible to exchange BTC Assets into TFT without any intermediary exchanger, by using an anchored version of BTC on The Stellar Network. This was possible by the trustline provided by [cryptoanchor.io](cryptoanchor.io); A Stellar Anchor For Crypto-Currencies.
Powered by Warp Drive. The BTC Asset that resides within your TF Connect Wallet is linked to the Cryptoanchor's. The ThreeFold Connect app calls the Cryptoanchor API for any operation on BTC within the ThreeFold Connect App. Therefore this asset should not be mistaken as a native asset. 

### Withdrawing your BTC Asset

Withdrawing BTC from the Stellar network comes with transaction fees which are defined by Cryptoanchor. None of the ThreeFold organisations intervenes in this transaction, and ThreeFold has no liability when it comes to holding BTC on the Stellar network. Please keep in mind that ThreeFold organisations has no commercial or cooperative relationship with this company.

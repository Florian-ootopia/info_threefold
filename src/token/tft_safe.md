### Keep Your TFT Safe

TFT isn't controlled by any government or company - it is a decentralized digital currency. 

This means TFT's open to be bought and used by anyone and stored on a digital ledger (aka blockchain).

But this also means you need to take the security of your funds seriously. 

With TFT, you’re not trusting a bank or a third party to look after your money, you’re trusting yourself.

# Wisdom Council

![](img/wisdom_council.png)

The Wisdom Council is composed of 10 ThreeFold Guardians.

## Mission

To financially support consciously aligned do-good projects and organizations, and protect the interests of the ThreeFold vision and mission.

*Based upon ancient leadership practices and modern social science techniques as a way to consider all perspectives of the members in order to make decisions that are in the greatest interest of the mission and for the good of all.*

10 members have the following functions:

- Protect the interests of the ThreeFold Foundation
- Approve TFT donations to doing good projects
- Agree on changes in protocol e.g. value of [Cloud Unit Reward](cloud_production_rate) Reward

## Process

ThreeFold Foundation prepares all the decisions to be taken by the Wisdom Council.
Eventually, voting happens using blockchain technology and is done by all Wisdom Council members.

## Members

Wisdom Council Members are community leaders chosen by Founders Circle due to their honorable integrity and exemplary service related to The Mission. Structure and balance of Member Seats is based on one's personal role, strength, purpose, archetypes and other respectful characteristics.

We also call a Wisdom Council Member a ThreeFold Guardian.

## Responsibility

In order to make balanced, fair and effective decisions regarding ThreeFold Foundation funds distribution, ThreeFold Foundation has adopted the Wisdom Council system as a resource model of harmonious communication.

Based upon the ageless principles of the Wisdom Council equation, Members will converge (online or live when possible) to discuss and vote upon the distribution of funds from ThreeFold Foundation to pre-approved and/or pre-selected do-good projects and organizations.

ThreeFold Foundation receives through the blockchain a small percentage of all cloud capacity farmed and sold on the ThreeFold Grid. 

These proceeds are used to further develop the ThreeFold Movement and later to benefit planetary do-good projects.

## Fit for duty requirements

- There is no ego involved by being a council member.
  - We realize our own reason to be a council member is to be at the service of our community and the planet.
- We work on self-development.
  - We realize we know nothing and are nothing but will always work in the best interest of the planet. The more we learn, the less we know.
  - We don’t blame others – change starts with ourselves.
  - We actively work on our *own* self-development (e.g. meditation, self-reflection, sessions with energy healers or spiritual coaches, etc.)
- We really believe the values as described on our [FreeFlow Nation](https://freeflownation.org/manifesto.html).
  - We know them, we understand them, we agree with them.
- We are not addicted to any substance (e.g. food, drugs)
  - We can make decisions without being influenced because of the desire for one of the above-mentioned topics.
- We are technical – we are able & willing to use digital currency wallets, GitHub (or alternative), markdown code, wiki texts, etc.
- We are willing to be a Guardian for at least 2 years starting our submission.

# Wisdom Council

![](img/wisdom_council.png)

In order to make balanced, fair and effective decisions regarding ThreeFold Foundation funds distribution, ThreeFold Foundation has adopted the Wisdom Council system as a resource model of harmonious decision making.


*Based upon ancient leadership practices and modern social science techniques as a way to consider all perspectives of the members in order to make decisions that are in the greatest interest of the mission and for the good of all.*

The Wisdom Council members converge (online or live when possible) to discuss and vote upon the distribution of funds from ThreeFold Foundation to pre-approved and/or pre-selected do-good projects and organizations.

ThreeFold Foundation receives through the blockchain a percentage of all cloud capacity farmed and sold on the ThreeFold Grid. These proceeds are used to further develop the ThreeFold Movement and later to benefit planetary do-good projects.

The Wisdom Council is composed of 9-12 members.

Wisdom Council has following veto rights:

- Approve TFT donations to ThreeFold related contribution projects or doing good projects.
- Agree on changes in protocol or required data on TFChain e.g. [farming reward](farming_reward), [pricing](grid_pricing) or [discount](staking_discount_levels) table. We expect that somewhere in the future our DAO will take over some of these functions.
- Approval of new [sales channels](threefold_sales_channel). The sales channels are recorded in TFChain (starting 3.1).

Next to this ThreeFold can ask for further guidance:

- Approval of changes on knowledge base (wiki) whenever community or a ThreeFold organization requires this.

## Process

ThreeFold Foundation prepares all the decisions to be taken and information to be reviewed by the Wisdom Council.
Voting happens using blockchain technology and is done by all Wisdom Council members.

Meeting minutes will be available on the https://info.threefold.io system. The first wisdom council meeting is planned for Summer 2021 and amongst others a review will happen for farming rewards, pricing & discount table.

## Members

Wisdom Council Members are community leaders chosen by Founders Circle due to their honorable integrity and exemplary service related to The Mission. Structure and balance of Member Seats is based on one's personal role, strength, purpose, archetypes and other respectful characteristics.

We also call a Wisdom Council Member a ThreeFold Guardian.

# Example 3Node as used in simulation

To calculate your own hardware, [see HW calculator](farming_hardware_calculator)

For this example, a Node (server) with good performance was chosen. The Node costs 3,300 EURs, had 32 CUs & 23 SUs - implying that there is a lot of capacity to be provided. 

1U of Rackspace (Data center rack, with height equivalent to 4.5 cm, can fit up 80 of these nodes. In this simulation, we use a Scaleout Box and put 60 nodes in 1 rack.

The chosen number of nodes consumes 250 watt per hour and 0.5 of rackspace. 

The standard sales price is 3,300 EUR and we allocate 75% of the cost price to Compute Units (CU).

Each node (server) can be categorized by using Compute Units (CUs) & Storage Units (SUs).

The chosen node is well optimized and has 32 CUs & 23 SUs.

The MRU/CRU/SRU/HRU are resource units that describe the physical capabilities of a node (server). They allow us to measure capacity on the hardware level and to convert it into Compute & Storage Units (CU & SU).

After calculation we can see that this node would have a cost price of $2.7 per CU and $1.5 per SU which is impressively low.

> Please note that the prices for CU are typically between $20 and $120  per month and for SU, between $20 and $160 per month - Showing how good and competitive the price of our CU and SU is. 

The Set-up Cost includes the license cost of certifying the farming solution. Note that this can be chosen on the parameter sheet.

# Farming Reward Calculator

We have created a calculator to allow you to simulate your potential return on investment of becoming a Farmer. Different nodes will produce a different CPR. 

The [Farming Logic v3 document](farming_logic3) describes how many TFT your node will receive as CPR_reward. 

Thanks to our sales model you also do not have to sell the capacity of your server(s), the threefold_approach takes care of this.

## Risks

- If 30% utlization isn't reached, your farmed tokens remain staked.
  - _Unlikely: cloud is a growing business, adoption and revenue will happen_
  - _FACT: ThreeFold tech technology is real and already working today, taking a percentage of the makrket is inevitable_
- ThreeFold Technology is not working
  - _FACT: The technology is already working today_
- The ThreeFold token does not appreciate in value
  - _Unlikely The cloud business by itself is growing and with increasing updat of the TF Grid as an alternative to the oligolopies there will be token scarsity._
  - _The ThreeFold_Council can make changes the business model to create more scarsity (burn a higher percentage of the tokens)._
- Digital Currencies become illegal
  - _Unlikely: This is not really possible because TFT has a utility - TFT represents  unit of compute and storage capacity._
  - _Even if this would happen despite all logic, then normal FIAT currencies can be used.  The token is only a effective means of value exchange._

## Remarks

- We have selected a [good representative server for the simulation, details see here](farming_hardware_remarks).
- The calculation is only valid for TFGrid_3.

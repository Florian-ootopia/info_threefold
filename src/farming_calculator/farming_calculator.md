# Farming Reward Calculator

We have created a calculator to allow you to simulate your potential return on investment of becoming a Farmer.

Each 3Node (server that delivers compute and storage capacity) produces CPR. 

The [Farming Logic v3 document](farming_logic3) describes how many TFT your server will receive as CPR_reward. You don't have to be an expert to become a ThreeFold Farmer. Our autonomous system does all the heavy lifting for you.

Thanks to our sales model you also do not have to sell the capacity of your server(s), the threefold_approach takes care of this.

## Risks

- Utilization does not go to 30% which means all your farmed tokens remain staked.
  - _Mitigation: you own the assets, cloud is a good business revenue should be possible_
  - _Mitigation: ThreeFold tech technology is real and already working today_
- ThreeFold Technology is not working
  - _Mitigation: The technology is already working today_
- The ThreeFold token does not appreciate in value
  - _Mitigation: The cloud business by itself is valuable_
  - _In this case ThreeFold_Council would change the business model to more cultivation_
- Digital Currencies become illegal
  - _Mitigation: This is not really possible because TFT is a real utility token, representing IT capacity._
  - _Even if this would happen despite all logic, then normal FIAT currencies can be used._

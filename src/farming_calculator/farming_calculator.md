# Farming Reward Calculator

We have created a calculator to allow you to simulate your own return on investment of becoming a farmer of IT/Internet capacity.

Each server (3node which delivers IT capacity) produces x nr of CPR. CPR is a cloud production rate and defines the output capability just like the kilowatt-hour (SI symbol: kWâ‹…h or kW h; commonly written as kWh) is would do for a solar pannel.


- CPR = Cloud Production rate, which is a nr which can be calculated per server (3node). 
  - CPR expresses the capability of a server in relation to production of IT (compute/storage) capacity.
- CPR_Reward = is the reward for being a farmer and is staked on the 3Node until 30% utilization of the capacity has been achieved. 
  - The TF_Council looks over this CPR reward and adjusts it over time in line with TFGrid growth and token price. Once rewarded to a farmer the CPR Reward does not change.

[Farming logic3 document](farming_logic3) describes how many TFT your server will receive as CPR_reward.

You don't have to be an expert to become a ThreeFold Farmer. Our autonomous system does all the heavy lifting for you.

Thanks to our sales model you also do not have to sell the capacity of your server(s), the threefold_channel approach takes care of this.

The big disruption ThreeFold brings is that we commodify this model, you don't have to be a cloud expert. Our autonomous system does all the heavy lifting for you. 


## The Used Terms

- CPR = Cloud Production rate, which is a nr which can be calculated per server (3node).
  - CPR expresses the capability of a server in relation to production of IT (compute/storage) capacity.
- CPR_Reward = is the reward for being a farmer and is staked on the 3Node until 30% utilization of the capacity has been achieved.
  - The TF_Council looks over the CPR reward and adjusts it over time in line with TFGrid growth and token price. Once rewarded to a farmer the CPR Reward does not change.

## Risks

- Utilization does not go to 30% which means farming of tokens does not happen.
  - _Mitigation: you own the assets, cloud is a good business revenue should be possible_
  - _Mitigation: ThreeFold tech technology is real and already working today_
- ThreeFold Technology is not working
  - _Mitigation: The technology is already working today_
- The ThreeFold token does not appreciate in value
  - _Mitigation: The cloud business by itself is valuable_
  - _In this case ThreeFold_Council would change the business model to more cultivation_
- Digital Currencies become illegal
  - _Mitigation: This is not really possible because the TFT is a real utility token, represents IT capacity._
  - _Even if this would happen despite all logic, then normal FIAT currencies can be used._

## Remarks

- We have selected a [good representative server for the simulation, details see here](farming_hardware_remarks).
- The calculation is only valid for TFGrid_3.

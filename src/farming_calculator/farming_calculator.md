# Farming Reward Calculator 

We have created a calculator to allow you to simulate your own return on investment of becoming a farmer of IT/Internet capacity.

To make it easy for a ThreeFold Farmer we work with CPR and [CPR_reward](cpr_reward_current).

- CPR = Cloud Production rate, which is a nr which can be calculated per server (3node). 
  - CPR expresses the capability of a server in relation to production of IT (compute/storage) capacity.
- CPR_Reward = is the reward for being a farmer and is staked on the 3Node until 30% utilization of the capacity has been achieved. 
  - The TF_Council looks over this CPR reward and adjusts it over time in line with TFGrid growth and token price. Once rewarded to a farmer the CPR Reward does not change.

We have selected a [good representative server for the simulation, check here for more info](farming_hardware_remarks). 

## Expected Return

Becoming a farmer is the same business model as any cloud or hosting vendor, you invest in hardware and allow others to use your hardware for deploying cloud workloads. 

The big disruption ThreeFold brings is that we commodify this model, you don't have to be a cloud expert. Our autonomous system does all the heavy lifting for you. 

Thanks to our sales model you also do not have to sell the capacity of your server(s), the threefold_channel approach takes care of this.

> Expected returns on becoming a ThreeFold farmer (cloud provider) is between 2x and 10x depending, growth of TFGrid and utilization of the cloud in your region.

## Risks

- Utilization does not go to 30% which means farming of tokens does not happen. 
  - *Mitigation: you own the assets, cloud is a good business revenue should be possible*
  - *Mitigation: ThreeFold tech technology is real and already working today*
- ThreeFold Technology is not working
  - *Mitigation: The technology is already working today*
- The ThreeFold token does not appreciate in value
  - *Mitigation: The cloud business by itself is valuable*
  - *In this case ThreeFold_Council would change the business model to more cultivation*
- Digital Currencies become illegal
  - *Mitigation: This is not really possible because the TFT is a real utility token, represents IT capacity.*
  - *Even if this would happen despite all logic, then normal FIAT currencies can be used.*

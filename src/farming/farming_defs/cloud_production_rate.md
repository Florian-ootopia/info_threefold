# The Cloud Production Rate (CPR)

The performance/productivity of a 3Node is calculated by the amount of [Cloud Units](cloudunits) (capacity) made available. This is summarized by a [Cloud Production Rate (CPR)](cloud_production_rate). 

CPR defines the output capability just like a Solar Panel's output would be measured in kilowatt-hour (kWh). 

The more capacity is added, the higher the CPR. and the more TFT is earned. It enables any Farmer to select the best 3Node option according to their available budget. 

To calculate the CPR, a very simple and straight-forward formula is used:

```
CPR = 1.5 x the amount of Compute Units (CU) of the hardware + the amount of Storage Units (SU) of the hardware
```

How CU and SU are composed and calculated by [cloud units](cloudunits).

> The CPR_Reward level of each 3Node is stored on the TF_Chain and cannot change over time. This permits the ThreeFold ecosystem to know how many tokens are rewarded to farmers over time. <BR>

Every "Planet Positive" Farmer can define a markup (extra margin) for each CU/SU, e.g. to compensate for extra costs related to a secure or strategic location. Minimal SLA's need to be achieved before the farming reward can be earned (uptime, bandwidth, latency, etc.)

For Planet Friendly Farmers, TFTs will go to a staking mechanism and only unlock if +30% of the 3Node's capacity is used.

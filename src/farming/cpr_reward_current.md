### ThreeFold Grid CPR Reward v3

| Description     | CPR reward in TFT per month | Cultivation |
| --------------- | --------------------------- | ----------- |
| Planet Positive | 20.0 TFT                    | 10%         |
| Planet Friendly | 14.0 TFT                    | 10%         |

ThreeFold Grid V3 CPR reward will start in June/July 2021.

> The CPR_Reward level of each 3Node is stored on the TF_Chain and cannot change over time. This permits the ThreeFold ecosystem to know how many tokens are rewarded to farmers over time. <BR>

Every "Planet Positive" Farmer can define a markup (extra margin) for each CU/SU, e.g. to compensate for extra costs related to a secure or strategic location. Minimal SLA's need to be achieved before the farming reward can be earned (uptime, bandwidth, latency, etc.)

TFTs will go to a staking mechanism and only unlock if +30% of the 3Node's capacity is used.

Minimal SLA's need to be achieved before the farming reward can be earned (uptime, bandwidth, latency, ...)

### CPR Reward Can Change Over Time

- CPR price is in line with TFT base price of 0.1, if base price changes so will CPR price.
- This CPR reward is managed by our wisdom_council.
- The Wisdom_council looks at the TFT price and market conditions to make sure there is a proper reward structure for any farmer.
  - Example, it could be logical that as the grid grows the cultivation nr can go up and farming nr can go down.
  - We believe in the power of a "human blockchain" to define the right reward for new farmers.

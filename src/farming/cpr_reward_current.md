# CPR Reward for March 2021 (TFGrid 3.0):

| description          | CPR reward in TFT per month | %cultivation |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------ |
| certified capacity   | 20.0 TFT                    | 10%          |
| diy (do it yourself) | 14.0 TFT                    | 10%          |


Once rewarded, this does not change, this value is registered in the tfgrid_chain.

All modalities to do with farming for one specific server= 3node is registered in the tf_chain, so that the farmer and the ecosystem of threefold knows exactly how many tokens will be rewarded over time to which farmer.
				
Every "certified" farmer can define a markup (extra margin) for each CU/SU 				
e.g. to compensate for extra costs related to e.g. secure location, or strategic location				
				
Farmed TFT gets staked per 3Node (per server) and only unlock if +30% is used of capacity.			

Minimal SLA's need to be achieved before the farming reward can be earned (uptime, bandwidth, latency, ...)			


### CPR Reward Can Change Over Time

- CPR price is in line with TFT base price of 0.1, if base price changes so will CPR price.
- This CPR reward is managed by our wisdom_council.
- The Wisdom_council looks at the TFT price and market conditions to make sure there is a proper reward structure for any farmer. 
  - Example, it could be logical that as the grid grows the cultivation nr can go up and farming nr can go down.
  - We believe in the power of a "human blockchain" to define the right reward for new farmers.

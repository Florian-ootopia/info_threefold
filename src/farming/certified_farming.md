# Certified Farming vs. Do It Yourself

Certified farming is not available yet. Later this year (2021) it will be made available to farmers. Certified Farming needs to comply to stronger levels of SLAs (Service Level Agreements).

Factors the TFGrid Reputation_engine will look at:
- Bandwidth
- Utilization
- Uptime

> Note: Farmers who are interested to become certified need to sign a contract with TF Tech in which the certification criteria is set. Once the contract is signed, the farm will be measured against the certification criteria which shows exactly if the certification remains certified or not according to the Reputation_engine.

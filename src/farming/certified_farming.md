# Planet Positive vs. Planet Friendly Farming

There are two types of Farming, Planet Positive (previously referred to as Certified) Farming and Planet Friendly (previously referred to as Do-it-Yourself) Farming. 

Planet Positive farming will be available in H2 2021. We are in the process of setting up agreements between Planet Positive Farmers & the ThreeFold Foundation.

## Planet Friendly Farming

By design, Zero OS can enable up-to 10x energy efficiency for certain workloads such as storage as compared to market alternatives. ThreeFold designed Zero OS to be super lightweight (200 MB) and efficient while delivering all the storage and compute primitives an Internet may need. 

ThreeFold offers a Farmer bot to facilitate the farm's management in relation to power management, farmed tokens management, network management tools, and protection mechanisms. Also ThreeFold's power management makes makes sure that your node is powered only when needed. This can save up even more energy.

## Planet Positive Farming

While the technology stack can save up-to 10% energy, it was important for ThreeFold to be more than just planet friendly. So we created a Planet Positive Farming model. This option enables Farmers to go beyond carbon neutrality and to help regenerate the earth while providing Internet capacity. 

With PLanet Positive Farming, the energy used by the node is offset x3 and is converted into carbon credits to be re-invested in climate action projects, e.g. reforestation.

### Planet Positive Criteria

```
Planet Positive Farming = Energy (SU + CU) + Trust (Proof-of-Authenticity) + Location (Decentralization)
```

1. Energy 

- KG of carbon used by your node. (For now it can easily be calculated based on SU and CU, but this will be measured in the future).
- Measured by the network of trust that verifies the authenticity of the information.

2. Proof-of-Authenticity

- A process by which your farm is evaluated by other farmers (authentic or not).
- Other Farmers verify the authenticity of your farm.
- Through an affiliation model, you can get authenticated by onboarding other farmers.
- This system creates a chain of trust.
- The more your farm is said to be authentic, the more points you get.
- The more authenticity you have, the faster you unlock from staking.

3. Connectivity (Location)

- By bringing Internet capacity to new locations, e.g. a remote area or refugee camp, you get more points.
- If you connect more than 1 node, the more you disperse you nodes, the more points you get.
- The more IP addresses you bring to the network, the more points you get.

ThreeFold believes that such a system will ensure an network of trust that rewards the biggest contributors to the ThreeFold Grid.

### Planet Positive Advantages

- Nodes get priority on the ThreeFold Grid as they help regenerate our planet.
- Farmers will have a better reputation within the ThreeFold Ecosystem by having their authenticity ratings visible on the tf_chain.
- Farmers can benefit from higher CPR rewards.
- Farmers get priority over ThreeFold support.
- Will be easier for farmers to unlock their TFT from the staking pool, capped at 30% utilization before unlocking.

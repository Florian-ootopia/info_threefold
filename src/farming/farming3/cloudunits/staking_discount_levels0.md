The discount is expressed in relation to nr of months of avg monthly usage

By staking TFT we express our loyalty and had to buy TFT upfront which means, we become like a co-investor in the grid. The level of our investment defines how much discount we get. Anyone can leave personal staking pool immediately, there is no lockup time, e.g. it means I can have staked 24 months for only 1 hour.

Example

I have 120.000 TFT staked, I used 10.000 TFT in one month, which means my discount will be 50% (silver plan)

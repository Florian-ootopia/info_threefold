The discount is expressed in relation to nr of months of avg monthly usage

The reasoning is by staking TFT I express my loyalty and had to buy TFT upfront which means, I become like a co-investor in the grid. The level of my investment defines how much discount I get.

A staker can get in and out of the pool any point in time, independent of month staking level.

Example

- I have 120.000 TFT staked, I used 10.000 TFT in one month, which means my discount will be 30% (silver plan)
- I use 1.000 TFT, but I have 0 staked, I will have a negative discount now, my fee will be 100% higher I will pay double.

# Farming Reward Table


!!!include:reward_table_

#### Remarks


- This reward scheme is 100% compatible with previous iteration which was based on CPR. 
- The Wisdom_council looks at the TFT price and market conditions to make sure there is a proper reward structure for any farmer.
  - Example, it could be logical that as the grid grows the cultivation nr can go up and farming nr can go down.
  - We believe in the power of a "human blockchain" to define the right reward for new farmers.
- CU/SU reward levels are fixed once node connected
  - The CU/SU reward levels of each 3Node are stored on the TF_Chain and cannot change over time. 
  - This permits the ThreeFold ecosystem to know how many tokens are rewarded to farmers over time. 
- Farming principles intro
  - TFTs farmed go to a staking mechanism per node and only unlock if +30% of the 3Node's capacity is used or max after 24 months.
  - Minimal SLA's need to be achieved before the farming reward can be earned (uptime, bandwidth, latency, ...)
  - More info see [Farming Hardware Calculator](farming_calculator)

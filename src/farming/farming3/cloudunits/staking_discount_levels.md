The discount is expressed in relation to nr of months of avg monthly usage

The reasoning is by staking TFT we express our loyalty and had to buy TFT upfront which means, we become like a co-investor in the grid. The level of our investment defines how much discount we get.

Example

- I have 120.000 TFT staked, I used 10.000 TFT in one month, which means my discount will be 30% (silver plan)
- I use 1.000 TFT, but I have 0 staked, I will have a negative discount now, my fee will be 100% higher I will pay double.

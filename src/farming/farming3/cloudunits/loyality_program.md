# Loyalty Program

Everyone can create a loyalty pool which gives a discount to anyone who staked tokens to that loyalty pool.

A loyalty pool has a certain level of discount in relation to the nr of months staking.

The discount is expressed in relation to nr of months of avg monthly usage

| type     | discount level | nr months staking |
| -------- | -------------- | ----------------- |
| bronze   | 10%            | 6 months          |
| silver   | 25%            | 12 months         |
| gold     | 35%            | 24 months         |
| platinum | 50%            | 36 months         |

The reasoning is by staking TFT in a loyalty pool I express my loyalty and had to buy TFT upfront which means, I become like a co-investor in the grid. The level of my investment defines how much discount I get.

A staker can get in and out of the pool any point in time, independent of month staking level.

Example

- TFT loyalty pool has 1m TFT and is a gold pool.
- I have staked 100k TFT in the pool so I have 10% of it
- Members of the pool can buy TFGrid capacity at 35% discount but with a maximum of 1/24 of the pool size in TFT.
- 1m TFT / 24 is the capacity on TFGrid expressed in TFT which pool members can buy at 35% discount.
- If I have 10% of pool it means I can buy capacity from TFGrid for max ```1.000.000 / 24 * 10% TFT``` at 35% discount

> the loyalty pools are not operational yet, today every user has 50% discount. <BR>
> the above terms can still change (june 2021)

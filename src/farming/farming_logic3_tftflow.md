# Farming Logic / Rewards v3 TFT Flows Details

### When capacity bought by Certified Sales Channel

We expect most of the business for next 6 months to come through our certified sales channels

- [ ] 25% of capacity bought through explorer 2.7 using TFT needs to be burned
- [ ] 10% of fee to farmer
- [ ] 10% of fee to TFFoundation (promotion_wallet_foundation)
- [ ] the remainder goes to certified sales channel

### When capacity bought by Farmer itself

- [ ] 25% of capacity bought through explorer 2.7 using TFT needs to be burned
- [ ] 10% of fee to farmer
- [ ] 5% of fee to TFFoundation
- [ ] 60% of fee to farmer

This basically means farmer gets rewarded to also sell his capacity.

### When capacity bought by any Grid User

We expect this to be very small in beginning

- [ ] 40% of capacity bought through explorer 2.7 using TFT needs to be burned
- [ ] 10% of fee to farmer
- [ ] 10% of fee to TFFoundation
- [ ] the remainder goes to promotion pool as held by wisdom council to promote future sales

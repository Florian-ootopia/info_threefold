# Buy a 3Node

Once you have decided what node type and/or [farming type](farming_types) you would like to have you can start and buy your node.
At ThreeFold Tech we have several options.

## Smaller Home Node Shop

First of we have the small nodes that you can [Buy here](https://shop.threefold.tech).

The Venus v2 is recommended only for home use when a good Fibre connection is available.

<!--- TODO: Talk to Kristof if we list this, if yes we need to refresh our pricing and see if we can get the components before September. --->

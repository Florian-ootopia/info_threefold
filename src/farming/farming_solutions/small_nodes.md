# Small Nodes (SoHo Nodes)

All Small / Soho Nodes (Small Office Home Office) are delivered in what we call a "plug an farm" state as they come totally pre-assembled with the farmers details already linked to the device. All they have to do is provide it with a source of power and internet connection and the node does the rest. 

Nodes ship out in batches per quarter to reduce unnecessary costs and waste of resources. This also allows us to optimize per batch and keep the hardware updated as we go.

To Pre-register for this quarter's batch please visit:

#### Carbon Double Win

- each CU & SU is being offset (by means of carbon credits) with 1 TFT (starting June 2021)
- this totals to 595 TFT for 5Y (happens month per month)

#### Cultivation Tokens (Tokens received for usage of your capacity.)

As Cultivation is harder to predict we can't put any numbers against it.
Of all cultivated tokens on a 3Node the farmer receives 10%.

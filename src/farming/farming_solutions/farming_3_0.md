# Farming & Cultivation 3.0

Starting TFGrid 3.0 the farming model got improved.

Farmers get more Farming Rewards but less Culitivation. The reason for this is that many farmers don't have influence nor the wish to be involved in the cultivation process. 

If they want they still can do so, see below and get even more rewards.

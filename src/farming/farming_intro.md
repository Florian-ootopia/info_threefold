# ThreeFold Farming

ThreeFold Farming is the process of connecting capacity to the ThreeFold Grid. The individuals and organizations that connect the servers are called Farmers. 

## What is Farming?

When a farmer connects a 3Node (server) to the ThreeFold_Grid, the total capacity of this server is detected by the ThreeFold's operating system - Zero-OS, and registered on the blockchain database. We call this proof-of-capacity. By keeping the server online, the farmer will be rewarded with [ThreeFold Tokens](token_what) (TFT) by the ThreeFold Foundation. We call this tf_farming.

Once 3Nodes are connected to the internet they become part of to the ThreeFold_Grid. Users can now deploy IT Workloads onto the TF_Grid. This process is known as tf_cultivation.

## What is 3Node?

A 3Node is a server/ hardware that runs ThreeFold's operating system Zero-OS. 3Nodes are connected to, and provide compute, storage and network to the ThreeFold Grid.

## Proof-of-Capacity

The proof-of-capacity records three resources from the 3node (server):

- Compute Capacity (CPU)
- Memory Capacity (RAM)
- Storage Capacity (SSD/HDD)

The proof-of-capacity is stored on a distributed storage system and hashed (fingerprinted). The hashes verify the authenticity of the report and are stored in the minting transactions on the blockchain. 4 days later, the TFTs are transferred to the farmer. The minting consensus needs to be achieved before minting can actually happen.

## Remarks

10% of farming proceeds go to the [benefits of the ecosystem](tfgrid_fee).

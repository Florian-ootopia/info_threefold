# ThreeFold Farming

ThreeFold Farming is the process of connecting Internet capacity to the ThreeFold Grid. 

## What is Farming?

Farming is the process of connecting Internet capacity (compute and storage) to the ThreeFold Grid in the form of server-type hardware and keeping it online. People and organizations that connect Internet capacity to the ThreeFold Grid are called Farmers.

Farmers earn [ThreeFold Tokens](token_what) (TFT) for creating Internet capacity in two ways:
- Farming: When connecting capacity and keeping it online, a Farmer gets rewarded on a monthly basis by the ThreeFold Foundation.
- Cultivation: When users reserve and use the provided Internet capacity to store their data or run IT workloads.

## Who can become a Farmer?

Farmers are independent people and organizations that believe in the need for a new Internet, and take part in the expansion of the ThreeFold Grid.

Anyone can become a Farmer on the ThreeFold Grid. No technical knowledge is required for someone to become a ThreeFold Farmer. ThreeFold's autonomous system does all the heavy lifting, making it easy for anyone to join. 

## What kind of hardware can be used for Farming?

Any Intel or AMD server type hardware that contains compute and/ or storage can be connected to the ThreeFold Grid. 
To connect hardware to the grid, ThreeFold's operating system Zero OS needs to be configured to boot the hardware. 

Once booted by Zero OS, the total capacity of the hardware will be detected and registered on the blockchain database and represented on the ThreeFold Grid Explorer. We call this proof-of-capacity.

## Proof-of-Capacity

The proof-of-capacity records three Internet resources from the 3node (server):

- Compute Capacity (CPU)
- Memory Capacity (RAM)
- Storage Capacity (SSD/HDD)

The proof-of-capacity is stored on a distributed storage system and hashed (fingerprinted). The hashes verify the authenticity of the report and are stored in the minting transactions on the blockchain. 4 days later, the TFTs are transferred to the farmer. The minting consensus needs to be achieved before minting can actually happen.

## Why become a farmer?

The Internet represents the largest economy in the world and is growing at a rapid pace. Here are a few statistics:

- Infrastructure growth: +125 Zettabytes (1 099 511 627 776 GB) of capacity to be connected in the next 5 years
- Revenue growth: +$800 Billion in revenue expected for the cloud market by 2025.
- Demand Growth: +70 Billion smart devices to join the Internet of Things network by 2025. 
- +1 Billion people to go digital in the next 5 years.

The ThreeFold Grid offers the perfect infrastructure to supply the increasing Internet demand. Learn more about the ThreeFold Grid [here](grid_home).
